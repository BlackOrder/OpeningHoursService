## Usage

### Importing the Package

You can import the `OpeningHoursService` in your project:

```typescript
import { OpeningHoursService } from '@blackorder/opening-hours-service';
```

Or if you are using CommonJS:

```typescript
const { OpeningHoursService } = require('@blackorder/opening-hours-service');
```

### Creating a Service Instance

To start using the service, instantiate it with optional initial data and timezone:

```typescript
const service = new OpeningHoursService(initialHours, 'America/New_York');
```

**Parameters:**
- `initialHours` *(optional)*: An array of `OpeningHoursSpecification` objects representing the initial opening hours data.
- `timezone` *(optional)*: A string specifying the timezone of the input data. Defaults to the user's local timezone if not provided.

### Adding Opening Hours

You can add opening hours for specific days using `addOpeningHour`:

```typescript
service.addOpeningHour('Monday', '09:00', '17:00', 'UTC');
```

Or add multiple opening hours in a batch:

```typescript
const additionalHours: OpeningHoursSpecification[] = [
  {
    '@type': 'OpeningHoursSpecification',
    dayOfWeek: 'Tuesday',
    opens: '10:00',
    closes: '14:00',
  },
  {
    '@type': 'OpeningHoursSpecification',
    dayOfWeek: 'Wednesday',
    opens: '11:00',
    closes: '15:00',
  },
];

service.addOpeningHoursBatch(additionalHours, 'America/Los_Angeles');
```

### Removing Opening Hours

You can remove all opening hours for a specific day:

```typescript
service.removeOpeningHoursForDay('Monday', 'UTC');
```

**Parameters:**
- `dayOfWeek`: The day of the week to remove (e.g., "Monday").
- `timezone` *(optional)*: The timezone in which to interpret the day of the week. Defaults to the user's local timezone if not provided.

### Checking If Business is Open

To check if the business is currently open, use:

```typescript
const isOpen = service.isOpenNow();
console.log(`Is open now: ${isOpen}`);
// Outputs: true or false
```

To check if the business is open at a specific date and time:

```typescript
const specificDate = new Date('2024-05-15T14:30:00');
const openAtSpecificTime = service.isOpenAt(specificDate);
console.log(`Is open at ${specificDate}: ${openAtSpecificTime}`);
// Outputs: true or false
```

### Exporting Opening Hours

To export the opening hours for a specific timezone:

```typescript
const hours = service.exportOpeningHours('Asia/Tokyo');
console.log(hours);
// Outputs: Array of OpeningHoursSpecification objects in Asia/Tokyo timezone
```

### Getting the Next Change in Opening Hours

Retrieve the next opening or closing time based on the current time or a specific reference time:

```typescript
const nextChange = service.getNextChange();
console.log(nextChange);
// Output example:
// { date: 2024-04-01T18:00:00.000Z, state: 'close' }

const specificDate = new Date('2024-04-01T10:00:00Z');
const nextChangeFromSpecificDate = service.getNextChange(specificDate);
console.log(nextChangeFromSpecificDate);
// Output example:
// { date: 2024-04-01T18:00:00.000Z, state: 'close' }
```

### Calculating Total Open Hours

Calculate the total number of open hours for the week:

```typescript
const totalHours = service.getTotalOpenHours();
console.log(`Total open hours this week: ${totalHours}`);
// Outputs: Number of total open hours
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s a full example demonstrating the basic usage of the `OpeningHoursService`:

```typescript
import { OpeningHoursService } from '@blackorder/opening-hours-service';

// Create an instance of the service
const service = new OpeningHoursService();

// Add opening hours for Monday
service.addOpeningHour('Monday', '09:00', '17:00', 'UTC');

// Check if the business is open right now
const isOpen = service.isOpenNow();
console.log(`Is open now: ${isOpen}`);
// Outputs: true or false

// Export the opening hours in New York timezone
const hours = service.exportOpeningHours('America/New_York');
console.log(hours);

// Get the next change in opening hours
const nextChange = service.getNextChange();
if (nextChange) {
    console.log(`Next change is to ${nextChange.state} at ${nextChange.date}`);
} else {
    console.log('No upcoming changes in opening hours.');
}

// Remove the Monday hours 
service.removeOpeningHoursForDay('Monday'); 
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Does the service support multiple timezones simultaneously?**

**A:** Yes, the service allows you to specify different timezones when adding or exporting opening hours.

**Q: How does the service handle opening hours that span midnight?**

**A:** The service does not allow opening hours that span midnight. Attempting to add such ranges will throw an error. Instead, split the opening hours into separate entries for each day.

**Q: Can I retrieve the opening hours for all days at once?**

**A:** Yes, you can use the `getOpenRangePerDay` method to retrieve open ranges for each day of the week.

## Conclusion

The Opening Hours Service provides a comprehensive and flexible solution for managing business hours across different timezones, ensuring accurate and reliable operations. Whether you need simple open/close checks or advanced scheduling features, this service has you covered.
